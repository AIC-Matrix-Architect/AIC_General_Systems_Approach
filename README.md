AIC-based problem articulation research paper 
The Exploratory Problem Analysis Process outlined is a structured approach for understanding and addressing problems within a complex system. This process involves:

1. Characterizing the problem and identifying influential factors or features using a TaskCoT (Chain-of-Thought) derived from a general predictive thinking framework.
2. Identifying random interactions within the system that appear without a clear purpose, and defining observed systems and their actions with a clear purpose.
3. Determining the primary purpose of each system's actions, which is to master or govern certain characteristics to enhance survival, utility, or viability.
4. Predicting auxiliary relationships that influence, control, or require appreciation of other systems or behaviors to achieve the primary purpose.
5. Analyzing factors and challenges within the problem domain to identify the most influential elements and potential sources of emergent issues.

This process is applied iteratively to develop a comprehensive understanding of the problem domain, guiding the decision-making towards effective solutions.

Background

The aviation industry faces significant challenges with mid-air collisions. The high velocities and potential for subsequent impacts during such incidents make the development of advanced detection and avoidance systems imperative.
Core Challenges

    Diverse Intruder Aircraft Detection: Aircraft vary in size and type, presenting unique detection challenges.
    Varied Weather Conditions Adaptation: Impaired visibility and sensor performance in different weather conditions.
    Operation Across Diverse Geographic Regions: Operational challenges vary from urban centers to remote regions.
    Functionality During Various Times of Day: Effectiveness of visual detection systems is influenced by lighting conditions.

Based on the work done by [3], we identified 75 factors influencing the aircraft detection problem.
